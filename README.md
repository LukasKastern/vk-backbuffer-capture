# What is vk-backbuffer-capture?

vk-backbuffer-capture provides applications with low-latency access to swapchain images generated by a target application.

## Prequisites
[Zig (0.11)](https://ziglang.org/download/).

## Build the project

```
git clone https://github.com/LukasKastern/vk-backbuffer-capture.git
cd vk-backbuffer-capture
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Usage

Start the target application with the capture shared object as preloaded.

```LD_PRELOAD=vk-backbuffer-capture/zig-out/libbackbuffer-capture.so vkcube```

The current way of transfering the textures requires ptrace permission.
E.g:
 
```
sudo setcap 'cap_sys_ptrace=ep' /home/yourname/Projects/backbuffer-capture/zig-out/bin/window-example
```
